The Arduino Arm Contoller

This is a sketch built for a robot build we're doing.  The build calls for a robot arm and for that arm to perform certian functions, predefined as the script calls for them.  

We wanted a arm that could also be slowed down and have safty measures in place (nested button flow requirements) so those were built in.

Additional modules to be built:

1.) Multi "arrackArm" array, multi arrays that the logic will walk thru for complex movements.
